# Core

A slightly retarted Vulkan-based engine.
Aims to be extremely well scaling up to 8-12 cores. (Technically infinite)

Goals:

Renderer
* Vulkan and OpenGL render paths
* Multithreading on Vulkan
* High polycount and automatic instancing
* Flexible post processing
* Megatexturing and texture streaming
* Rendertextures
* Global illumination of some sorts
* Reflections! Shinyy!

Audio
* OpenAL or similar
* Doppler
* Binaural audio (fancy ear simulation and timing stuff)
* VoIP

Physics
* Bullet or similar
* Rigidbodys (duh)
* Smoke
* Fluid
* High performance particles

Network
* IDK I havent done much network planning yet
